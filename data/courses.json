Even the most fundamental concepts like compilation & interpretation are explained. All other topics are covered in-depth starting from language basics, object-oriented concepts & design, JVM internals, exceptions, IO, collections framework, generics, multi-threading, databases, nested classes, enums, and functional-style programming via Java 8 constructs like lambdas & streams. You'll also learn about database designing, implementation (SQL), and how to interact with them from Java programs (via JDBC). The course also gives a very good introduction to Java EE technologies like JSP, Servlets and JSTL, which help in project implementation. Finally, an excellent Eclipse IDE tutorial is also included, which teaches you how to use Eclipse professionally for effectively writing, debugging and even testing Java programs using the JUnit framework.Each lecture has been very carefully crafted explaining the motivation behind every concept. Each concept is clearly explained with well thought out examples & illustrations and is demonstrated in code. Object-oriented concepts like inheritance & polymorphism are explained through a real-world case-study, which is also implemented as part of the course project. Several challenging coding exercises & quizzes are included to reinforce what you've learned. Your solutions for coding exercises are also auto-evaluated to help you instantly know whether or not the solution is correct."
